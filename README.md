# GamesEngine1_Assignment_1

For my Games Engine project I would like to create a 3D music visualizer. The music visualizer would be something similar to the pictures below where the shapes change according to the music, But the one that I want to create would be in 3D.
The user would be able to upload a piece of music and the music visualizer would change according to the sounds from the music.
