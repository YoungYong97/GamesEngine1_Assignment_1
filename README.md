This Unity Application takes in an audio file(music) and then visualizes the audio. This application is made up of a ring of 32 cubes and a line of eight cubes. I modified the cubes so that the cubes only scale in one direction and on both ways.

## Proposal
For my Games Engine project I would like to create a 3D music visualizer. The music visualizer would be something similar to the pictures below where the shapes change according to the music, But the one that I want to create would be in 3D.
The user would be able to upload a piece of music and the music visualizer would change according to the sounds from the music.
